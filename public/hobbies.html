<h1>Fun Stuff!</h1>

<h2>Pilates</h2>
<p>
  Outside work, I enjoy practicing and teaching Pilates. I first got introduced
  to Pilates by watching my mom's old-school DVD's, but it wasn't until 2019
  when I started practicing reformer Pilates regularly. From not even being able
  to hold a plank in my first class, after a few weeks I found myself getting
  stronger and enjoying exercise again. But more importantly, Pilates changed my
  relationship with my body - I used to just try to make it smaller but through
  Pilates I learned to really see and feel my body and be grateful for all it
  could (and could not) do.

<h2>Tea</h2>
<p>
  In college I started drinking tea to stay focused during studying, hoarding
  whatever cheap tea bags I could find in the dining hall. But after my dear
  friend, Katelyn, introduced me to bourgie loose-leaf teas, I was hooked. I
  became someone who created excel spreadsheets comparing tea from different
  stores and even went to Taipei to find a direct-to-consumer tea "dealer".
</p>

<p>
  Since then, I've gotten into matcha lattes (also thanks to Katelyn!), and as a
  lactose-intolerant girly, I'm very big into increasing the distribution points
  of oat milk around the world (@cafes in Europe, please see this!!!).

<h2>Crafts I start and don't finish</h2>
<p>
  RIP to all the crafts I start but don't finish. I love to make things (hence
  this project)! But I realise I like to buy things to make things more. Even
  so, see below some of the fun things I've made.
